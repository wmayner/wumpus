My CleverAgent seems to do well for test cases 1 and 2, but on 3 (the big
one) it takes wayyy to long. I doubt it'll be able to finish 100 trials in
under half an hour. Hopefully I wasn't the only one with this problem and
you guys'll grade us based on the first two test cases XD

Also, this shouldn't need python 2.7 - but if it breaks, please try it with
2.6!
