 

You step through the portal and find yourself facing NORTH
You are in the sophisticated room. 
The instant you set foot inside the room, the ground opens up beneath you and swallows you whole. The pile of bones cushions your fall, but the sucker marks on the wall make you wish it hadn't...
You perceive unbearable PAIN
You fire an arrow to the SOUTH, straight and true
Your arrow finds its mark, and slays the Wumpus. At long last, the world is free from that accursed tentacled beast!
You perceive a bloodcurdling SCREAM
